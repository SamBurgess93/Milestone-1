# BB Fitness

Milestone project - User Centric Frontend development

This project will be used to promote a Personal Training service. 
The aim is to encourage potential customers to join the movement and sign up to the free 30 day fitness challenge and as a result take up the service long term.

The idea is that by properly describing the story of the trainers own fitness journey (Ben Burgess) this will inspire others who are in the same situation to make the change in their own lives.

## Showcase

## UX

### User Stories
The user of this website will be people who want to increase their own fitness levels and people who can relate to the story of the business owner.
Ages ranging from 18-50 and will be mostly accessed on mobile devices.
The user will want to see the story behind the business and see what services are offered.
The user will want to see how they can get in contact to get started on their journey.

The website will invite the user to interact with a colour scheme and a user-friendly experience. They will be able to sign up for the 30 day challenge and be able to get in touch to start their journey and also have links to the social links.

A user will want to relate to the owners story.
A user will want to see what services are on offer.
A user will want to see more on the tyhe businesses social media platforms.
A user will want to see some customer feedback.
A user will want to see how to get in touch.


### Strategy


#### User Needs.
The potential user will need the information contained in the application to be concise and easily accessed. The application will need to be easily navigated by mobile devies such as phones and tablets.


#### Technical Capabilites
This project can be created in the available timeframe using the Bootstrap HTML & CSS framework.

#### Business Vision
The purpose of this project is to introduce new people to the fitness movement. By showing what services can be offered and telling the story of the owner 
the aim is to have people sign up to the free 30 day challenge to sample the services with the desired outcome being a longer membership sign up afterwards.
With people visiting the site it is envisaged that the social media pages will in turn get more clicks. 

### Scope
For the users to my website I wanted to highlight to them that they can change their lives and become a happier and healthier person by signing up for some personal training.


### Structure
The main structure of the website will be a single page application with a main hero image and text that the user see first whe they visit the site.
On scrolling down the user will come upon the About Me section which tells the story of the owners own battle with weight loss that will bring a sense of togetherness and relatability 
to the application. What follows then is the Services section whcih highlights to the user what they can expect from BB fitness and how this 
differentiates this from others. This will include a call to action button to get in touch to start the process. After the services the user is met with the 30 day fitness challenge
section which will invite the user to sign up for the free fitness programme. Following this is a embedded motivational video to create a positive emotional response from the user.
A review section then follows which showcases what existing clients have to say about BB fitness. This is then followed by the contact form and the footer which contains the links to
the social media channels.

## Testing



### Testing planning.
At the start of the project I had to take into account the needs of the user and the devies they would be using to view the application.

Using Chrome tools I tested using the following devices;

iPhone 5/SE (320 x 568)
iPhone 6/7/8 (375 x 667)
iPhone 6/7/8 Plus (414 x 716)
iPhone X (375 x 812)
iPad (768 x 1024)
iPad Pro (1024 x 1366)
Laptop with HiDPI Screen (1440 x 900)

I tested with other screens I have;
Samsung S9 mobile
23.8" Desktop Screen (1920 x 1080)
Laptop 14" (1920 x 1080)


### Implementation
I used Google Chrome dev tools to debug and test my code. I used the 'mobile first' approach so I debugged on the smallest screen first and worked my way up to the largest. 
I also tested using the handheld devices I owned to make the testing more accurate.

The main method of testing I used was implenting/ changing styles in the Chrome Dev Tools first to see how it looked on various device sizes. If this was satisfactory then I would paste the code over to my HTML/CSS to make the change permanent.

I also used Lighthouse to test the accessability of the site and W3 validator to test my code.

### Results and outcomes

### Validator

I used the W3C Validator to check my HTML code. The first error I encountered was that in my embedded code for the YouTube video the frameborder attribute is obselete in HTML5. I had to implement this is in my CSS instead.
