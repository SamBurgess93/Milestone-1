# BB Fitness

Milestone project - User Centric Frontend development

This project will be used to promote a Personal Training service. 
The aim is to encourage potential customers to join the movement and sign up to the free 30 day fitness challenge and as a result take up the service long term.

The idea is that by properly describing the story of the trainers own fitness journey (Ben Burgess) this will inspire others who are in the same situation to make the change in their own lives.

## Showcase
A deployed link to the website can be found [here](https://samburgess93.github.io/Milestone-1/).

## UX

### User Stories
The user of this website will be people who want to increase their own fitness levels and people who can relate to the story of the business owner.
Ages ranging from 18-50 and will be mostly accessed on mobile devices.
The user will want to see the story behind the business and see what services are offered.
The user will want to see how they can get in contact to get started on their journey.

The website will invite the user to interact with a colour scheme and a user-friendly experience. They will be able to sign up for the 30 day challenge and be able to get in touch to start their journey and also have links to the social links.

### Strategy


#### User Needs.
The potential user will need the information contained in the application to be concise and easily accessed. The application will need to be easily navigated by mobile devies such as phones and tablets.


#### Technical Capabilites
This project can be created in the available timeframe using the Bootstrap HTML & CSS framework.

#### Business Vision
The purpose of this project is to introduce new people to the fitness movement. By showing what services can be offered and telling the story of the owner 
the aim is to have people sign up to the free 30 day challenge to sample the services with the desired outcome being a longer membership sign up afterwards.
With people visiting the site it is envisaged that the social media pages will in turn get more clicks. 

### Scope
For the users to my website I wanted to highlight to people that they can change their lives and become a happier and healthier person by signing up for some personal training.
